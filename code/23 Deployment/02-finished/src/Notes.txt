These are the steps required to deploy our React application to a remote server:
1. Test Code: Manually & with automated tests
2. Optimize Code: Optimize user experience & performance
3. Build App: Run build process to parse, transform & optimize code
4. Upload App: Upload production code to hosting server
5. Configure Server: Ensure app is served securely & as intended

For optimizing code, we have implemented lazy loading in this project. Lazy loading reduces the
loading time for a website when the user first visits it as it can display the website even when
all of its code has not been fetched from the server.

For building the app, we must run 'npm run build' to build the application for deployment on
production. We will get a 'build' folder which contains the code that must be deployed.

For uploading app, we have used 'Firebase' in this project. We have also enabled SPA option
(Single-Page Application) while deploying which will ensure that our app works as an SPA after
deployment. This ensures that routing is done not on the server-side but on the client-side and
the server returns the same default file for any route we visit and the actual routing is taken
care of by our client-side code.
